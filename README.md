First things first
------------------

Learn [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)! Then check out MDwiki's [quick start](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!quickstart.md).

Whenever you feel stuck, go to [MDwiki's own site](http://mdwiki.info) for further information.


How to Preview
==============

In order to preview your changes locally, prior to publishing online, you may need to take some actions. Below some starting points for each operating system, also check out MDwiki's [frequently asked questions](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!faq.md) section for some ideas.

Mac OS
------

The easiest way to serve up static sites on a Mac is to use [Anvil](http://anvilformac.com). Go ahead and download it from their website, install and add a site using the status bar icon: simply select the folder where your wiki is located on your Mac.
